CGPA (Cancer Gene Prognosis Atlas) is an innovative online tool designed to enhance gene-centric biomarker discovery and validation in cancer genomics. CGPA offers comprehensive analysis capabilities, addressing the limitations of existing databases by offering multivariable and multi-gene survival models, crucial for accurate prognostic assessments. It provides an intuitive platform for researchers and clinicians, facilitating the exploration of gene expression's impact on clinical outcomes, a task often hindered by the complexity and volume of data in current cancer transcriptome databases. CGPA's unique functionalities also enable the effective mining of gene correlations and the creation of customizable gene panels, significantly advancing the field of oncological research.
